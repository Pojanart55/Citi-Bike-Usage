# Citi Bike Usage Analysis: November-December 2024

## Overview

This repository contains the Tableau Public workbook and supporting files for an individual analysis of Citi Bike trip data in New York City during November and December 2024. The analysis explores overall usage patterns, differences in behavior between casual and member riders, and the spatial distribution of trip origins and destinations. A particular point of interest was to examine these patterns in the context of unseasonably warm temperatures experienced during these months due to global warming.

## Story Narrative

The Tableau Story guides the viewer through the analysis with the following points:

1.  **Introduction:** Sets the context of the analysis, highlighting the unseasonably warm temperatures in November and December 2024 and the motivation to understand Citi Bike usage under these conditions.
2.  **Overall Usage:** Presents the overall trip volumes and temporal trends, noting the December surge in member ridership.
3.  **Rider Behavior:** Explores the differences in trip duration and peak usage times between casual and member riders, suggesting different usage patterns.
4.  **Spatial Usage Patterns:** Visualizes the popular start and end station locations, identifying core usage areas in Manhattan and western Brooklyn, and noting lower engagement in the outer boroughs.
5.  **Conclusion and Recommendations (Implicit in the analysis):** Summarizes the key findings regarding overall usage, rider behavior, and spatial patterns, offering insights for city officials and Citi Bike administrators.

## Key Findings

* December 2024 saw a significant increase in overall Citi Bike usage, primarily driven by a surge in member ridership.
* Casual riders consistently took longer trips compared to members, who likely used the service for shorter commutes.
* Member riders exhibited peak usage during typical commute hours, while casual rider usage was highest during midday.
* Citi Bike usage was heavily concentrated in Manhattan and western Brooklyn, with significantly lower activity in Queens and the Bronx.
* The unseasonably warm temperatures may have contributed to sustained or increased ridership in the late fall and early winter months, though further analysis would be needed to definitively establish this link.
